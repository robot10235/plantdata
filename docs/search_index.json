When we talk about global warming, we will imagine the glacier melts in the polar region and high mountains, sea level rises making some islands sink, and summer becomes hotter than past years. Global warming not only changes human life, but also impacts all living things around the world. For example, the area of occurrences of plants may change since plants may live in higher latitude or higher elevation area as years pass because of rise of average temperature caused by global warming. In order to find out these changes, the data of all native plants in Australia should be needed. However, we can not collect complete data due to the limited conditions. We choose the data which is used for research to draw the conclusions. The results we are going to show can not represent for all native plant species in Australia, but it does show some changes happen to the plants somehow. In this project, we analyze the occurrences of plants with lots of records with restrictions of coordinate uncertainty in metres in Australia in GBIF(Global Biodiversity Information Facility). The download link is: https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.knbx8a. We would like to carry out analysis from both geographic and time analysis perspectives and answer the following questions: What is the relationship between latitudes of occurrence areas of plants and years? What is the relationship between elevations of occurrence areas of plants and years? Where have they lived these years? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources In biogeography, a native species is indigenous to a given region or ecosystem if its presence in that region is the result of only local natural evolution (though often popularised as “with no human intervention”. It is an antonym of invasive plants. The reason why we analyze occurrences of native plants not invasive plants is that the living area of invasive plants is very unstable compared to natural plants. Since GBIF provides some simple selections to purge data, the data we chose which contains Australia native plants. It has restrictions that the coordinate uncertainty in metres must be smaller than 10000, in order to help us draw more accurate results. Some columns descriptions are shown as follows. datasetKey The occurrence dataset key (a uuid) occurrenceID A unique identifier for the occurrence, allowing the same occurrence to be recognized across dataset versions as well as through data downloads and use (see Darwin Core Terms: A quick reference guide) Ideally, the occurrenceID is a persistent global unique identifier. As a minimum requirement, it has to be unique within the published dataset. It allows to recognize the same occurrence over time when the dataset indexing is refreshed; it links additional data like images; and it makes it possible to cite records e.g. in usage reports or in publications. This means that the occurrenceID needs to reliably stay with the occurrence at source, and to consistently refer to the same occurrence in published datasets and any underlying source data. taxonRank The taxon rank supports the interpretation of the scientific name during indexing, and supports matching the occurrence record to the core taxonomy, especially in the case of names at genus level or above (monomials). While the format of higher taxon names in some groups contains indicators of their rank, this is not consistent across or even within groups, and cannot be reliably used for interpretation. For placing names correctly, explicitly specifying the taxon rank, alongside information on the higher taxonomy, is an important criterion. For practical purposes, the ranks used have to be (major) Linnean ranks: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species. Both Latin or English terms are accepted. scientificName A scientific name from the GBIF backbone. All included and synonym taxa are included in the search. countryCode The 2-letter country code (as per ISO-3166-1) of the country in which the occurrence was recorded. See here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 locality (character) The specific description of the place. stateProvince (character) The name of the next smaller administrative region than country (state, province, canton, department, region, etc.) in which the Location occurs. occurrenceStatus Type status of the specimen. publishingOrgKey (character) The publishing organization key (a UUID). decimalLatitude Latitude in decimals between -90 and 90 based on WGS 84. Supports range queries, smaller,larger (e.g., ‘25,30’, whereas ‘30,25’ wouldn’t work) decimalLongitude Longitude in decimals between -180 and 180 based on WGS 84. Supports range queries (e.g., ‘-0.4,-0.2’, whereas ‘-0.2,-0.4’ wouldn’t work). elevation Elevation in meters above sea level. Supports range queries, smaller,larger (e.g., ‘5,30’, whereas ‘30,5’ wouldn’t work) depth Depth in meters relative to elevation. For example 10 meters below a lake surface with given elevation.

Supports range queries, smaller,larger (e.g., ‘1990,1991’, whereas ‘1991,1990’ wouldn’t work) taxonKey (numeric) A taxon key from the GBIF backbone. All included and synonym taxa are included in the search, so a search for aves with taxononKey=212 (i.e. /occurrence/search?taxonKey=212) will match all birds, no matter which species. You can pass many keys by passing occ_search in a call to an lapply-family function. basisOfRecord Basis of record, as defined in our BasisOfRecord enum here https://gbif.github.io/gbif-api/apidocs/org/gbif/api/vocabulary/BasisOfRecord.html Acceptable values are: FOSSIL_SPECIMEN An occurrence record describing a fossilized specimen.

Issues passed to this parameter filter results by the issue. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The data has some information about taxonRank which is higher than species. That is because the species data is missing. ## family genus taxonRank decimalLatitude decimalLongitude ## 17 Rubiaceae Psychotria GENUS -16.47347 145.3261 ## 31 Dicranaceae Leucobryum GENUS -15.89014 145.2428 ## 57 Caulacanthaceae Catenella GENUS -26.80674 153.1427 ## 80 Ericaceae Styphelia GENUS -10.15684 142.1761 ## 82 Malvaceae Seringia GENUS -19.00679 146.0928 ## 95 Campanulaceae Isotoma GENUS -12.04167 142.5583 ## 96 Dilleniaceae Hibbertia GENUS -28.84008 151.9761 ## 104 Lamiaceae Prostanthera GENUS -25.30978 151.4366 ## 129 Ericaceae Leucopogon GENUS -28.24778 153.1381 ## 148 Poaceae Eriachne GENUS -20.69278 145.2361 We do not know this kind of information belongs to which specific species. And we know that the living area of different species in the same genus could be much different. For example, two data with same genus without species information has much different latitude and longitude. ## family genus taxonRank decimalLatitude decimalLongitude ## 315074 Atherospermataceae Daphnandra GENUS -17.37 145.72 ## 348821 Atherospermataceae Daphnandra GENUS -31.45 151.17 Therefore, we should use the information of taxonRank which is species or lower rank and drop the higher rank. Since all species have speciesKey, we can easily drop data with no speciesKey. Check columns and choose informative ones. ## [1] &quot;species&quot; &quot;stateProvince&quot; ## [3] &quot;individualCount&quot; &quot;decimalLatitude&quot; ## [5] &quot;decimalLongitude&quot; &quot;coordinateUncertaintyInMeters&quot; ## [7] &quot;coordinatePrecision&quot; &quot;elevation&quot; ## [9] &quot;elevationAccuracy&quot; &quot;depth&quot; ## [11] &quot;depthAccuracy&quot; &quot;month&quot; ## [13] &quot;year&quot; &quot;speciesKey&quot; We also notice that some species only appear several times.

Most of them are in Magnoliopsida class. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Visualize the missing pattern of the data which we have purged before. Observing the plot, we can easily find out some correlations among some factors. LA means latitude and LO means longitude, so if one of them is missing, the other one must be missing too. The plot reveals this correlation. The similar correlation also appears between DP(depth) and DPA(depth accuracy), and EA(elevation accuracy) and ELE(elevation). Another correlation is between Y(year) and M(month). Year is more easily be recorded than month. DP, DPA, COPRE(coordinate precision), CNT are more likely to be missing. We might use elevation to conduct some results since nearly half of them are not missing. COUN(coordinate uncertainty in meter) has no missing because we first downloaded data with limitation of COUN smaller than 10000. And SP(species), SK(species key) has no missing data because at chapter 3 we purge all missing species key data. ST(state), Y has no missing at all. ST(state) and Y(year) is much easier to record. Although LA, LO and M have some missing values, these cases are actually very small. We can notice the top graph that it is not very obvious to show that these columns have missing values. As for the right graph, we can find that the missing pattern that these columns have are smallest subset in the whole data. Therefore, we can think these columns have no missing values. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 The correlation between latitude and year. 5.2 The correlation between elevation and year.", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 The correlation between latitude and year. In order to find out the correlation between latitude and year, we need to purge some data whose latitude and year may not be relative. For instance, this is one of species called Utricularia dichotoma, the correlation coefficient between latitude and year is very small. ## [1] -0.2643478 The scatter plot of its latitude and year seems messy. It is hard to describe the correlation between them. The reason why it happens is probably wrong records or the characteristic of plants. Utricularia dichotoma usually grows in wet locations and the moisture must be more important than temperature to the living of the species causing the mess of the scatter plot. Therefore, if the correlation coefficient is smaller than 0.3, we think no correlation exists. We calculate the correlation coefficient of latitude and year of each species, and choose its absolute value which is not less than 0.3. There are 19 species met the condition. Here are the species, correlation coefficients and slopes. ## species corr slope ## 1 Dodonaea viscosa -0.6164304 -0.11727618 ## 2 Senna artemisioides 0.4211296 0.05817406 ## 3 Fimbristylis dichotoma 0.4434433 0.11950931 ## 4 Phyllanthus virgatus 0.3432119 0.09504150 ## 5 Acacia stenophylla -0.4208420 -0.11654206 ## 6 Eucalyptus viridis -0.4329529 -0.09038205 ## 7 Chenopodium spinescens -0.4545116 -0.10070991 ## 8 Acacia longifolia -0.3958642 -0.01009835 ## 9 Acacia floribunda -0.3909243 -0.06952318 ## 10 Microtis unifolia -0.3142659 -0.04972729 ## 11 Eucalyptus leucoxylon -0.5130337 -0.02620439 ## 12 Grevillea rosmarinifolia -0.4161934 -0.02937272 ## 13 Leptospermum laevigatum -0.3984328 -0.01405949 ## 14 Acacia sophorae -0.3616717 -0.04643329 ## 15 Melaleuca decussata -0.3287825 -0.01057844 ## 16 Melaleuca armillaris -0.3670337 -0.01799621 ## 17 Acacia provincialis -0.4431635 -0.01237274 ## 18 Acacia pravissima -0.4170265 -0.01556202 ## 19 Dodonaea procumbens -0.3396470 -0.01255465 Observing the table, we can find that there are 3 species have positive correlation coefficients and 16 species have negative ones. It is worth noting that all latitudes are smaller than 0 since Australia is located in the southern hemisphere. Therefore, the negative correlation means the latitude gets higher as years pass. We show the correlation between latitude and years among 63 species as follows. The result is that about 70% of the species have no correlation between latitude and year. Nearly 25% of the species have negative correlations and 5% of the species have positive ones. We are interested in whether the changes of latitude are significant. The null hypothesis is that the correlation subjects to the normal distribution, which means that the change of is normal. Q-Q plot, density curve and Shapiro Wilk test result are presented. We can find that since p-value is very large, it does subject to the normal distribution, which means that the change of latitude is normal. But we still find that the density curve leans to left a little bit, which means the latitude has a tendency to get higher. ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: all_la_y_corr$corr ## W = 0.97777, p-value = 0.3107 We are also interested in different correlations in different class: Liliopsida and Magnoliopsida. We can see that the latitudes of Magnoliosida plants are more likely get higher, but the correlation is not significant. And Liliopsida plants do not have any correlation between latitudes and years. 5.2 The correlation between elevation and year. We do the same thing to analyze the correlation between elevation and year. The result is that about 62% of the species have no correlation. Around 25% of the species have positive correlations and 13% of the species have negative ones. We also present the Q-Q plot, density curve and Shapiro Wilk test result to show whether the correlation subject to normal distribution. At 10 percent level of significance, we can reject the null hypothesis. It means that the change of elevation is not normal in the last 50 years. We can notice that the density curve leans to left, which means that the elevation has a tendency to get higher. ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: all_ele_y_corr$corr ## W = 0.9655, p-value = 0.07442 Different correlations in different class are also presented as follows. The elevations of Liliopsida plants are more likely get higher as years pass, but the correlation is not significant. It seems the Magnoliopsida do not have such correlation since its center lies near zero. Result: The latitude of occurrences of Australia native plants in the last 50 years has a tendency to get higher, but the change is minor. The elevation of occurrences of Australia native plants in the last 50 years has a tendency to get higher and the change is significant to some extent. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In this project, we discover the correlation between latitude and year and between elevation and year of Australia popular research native plants in the last 50 years. The result we conclude is not quite significant since global warming is a much longer process. And because many other factors can impact plants living such as rainfall, illumination and human factors, the living area of plants is not stable and the minor change of temperature might have a little impact on it. But we still find something in this minor changes. In the result of correlation between latitude and year we can find that the number of negative correlation is much larger than the positive one, which means that plants which have correlation are more likely to live in higher latitude area with years pass. In the result of correlation between elevation and year we can find that the number of positive correlation is much larger than the negative one, which means that plants which have correlation are more likely to live in higher elevation area with years pass. These results imply that native plants in Australia have a tendency to live in higher latitude and elevation area, which further reveal global warming somehow.
