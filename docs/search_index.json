Import data The data has some information about taxonRank which is higher than species. That is because the species data is missing. ## family genus taxonRank decimalLatitude decimalLongitude ## 4 Hypnaceae Hypnum GENUS 44.31670 -104.6833 ## 5 Orthotrichaceae Orthotrichum GENUS 45.53330 -109.8167 ## 6 Isoetaceae Isoetes GENUS 34.30690 -80.9853 ## 7 Bryaceae Rosulabryum GENUS 39.45000 -122.7500 ## 8 Sphagnaceae Sphagnum GENUS 45.53330 -84.6667 ## 9 ORDER 31.59056 -110.5067 ## 10 Sphagnaceae Sphagnum GENUS 39.41670 -79.0667 ## 11 Mniaceae FAMILY 41.81342 -124.0647 ## 14 Haloragaceae Myriophyllum GENUS 38.52333 -121.7861 ## 15 Rhabdoweisiaceae Amphidium GENUS 38.91419 -123.2563 We do not know this kind of information belongs to which specific species. And we know that the living area of different species in the same genus could be much different. For example, two data with same genus without species information has much different latitude and longitude. ## family genus taxonRank decimalLatitude decimalLongitude ## 23 Orthotrichaceae Zygodon GENUS 41.80417 -124.0604 ## 210403 Orthotrichaceae Zygodon GENUS 20.76878 -156.2339 Therefore, we should use the information of taxonRank which is species or lower rank and drop the higher rank. Since all species have speciesKey, we can easily drop data with no speciesKey. Check columns and choose informative ones. ## [1] &quot;gbifID&quot; &quot;datasetKey&quot; ## [3] &quot;occurrenceID&quot; &quot;kingdom&quot; ## [5] &quot;phylum&quot; &quot;class&quot; ## [7] &quot;order&quot; &quot;family&quot; ## [9] &quot;genus&quot; &quot;species&quot; ## [11] &quot;infraspecificEpithet&quot; &quot;taxonRank&quot; ## [13] &quot;scientificName&quot; &quot;verbatimScientificName&quot; ## [15] &quot;verbatimScientificNameAuthorship&quot; &quot;countryCode&quot; ## [17] &quot;locality&quot; &quot;stateProvince&quot; ## [19] &quot;occurrenceStatus&quot; &quot;individualCount&quot; ## [21] &quot;publishingOrgKey&quot; &quot;decimalLatitude&quot; ## [23] &quot;decimalLongitude&quot; &quot;coordinateUncertaintyInMeters&quot; ## [25] &quot;coordinatePrecision&quot; &quot;elevation&quot; ## [27] &quot;elevationAccuracy&quot; &quot;depth&quot; ## [29] &quot;depthAccuracy&quot; &quot;eventDate&quot; ## [31] &quot;day&quot; &quot;month&quot; ## [33] &quot;year&quot; &quot;taxonKey&quot; ## [35] &quot;speciesKey&quot; &quot;basisOfRecord&quot; ## [37] &quot;institutionCode&quot; &quot;collectionCode&quot; ## [39] &quot;catalogNumber&quot; &quot;recordNumber&quot; ## [41] &quot;identifiedBy&quot; &quot;dateIdentified&quot; ## [43] &quot;license&quot; &quot;rightsHolder&quot; ## [45] &quot;recordedBy&quot; &quot;typeStatus&quot; ## [47] &quot;establishmentMeans&quot; &quot;lastInterpreted&quot; ## [49] &quot;mediaType&quot; &quot;issue&quot; ## [1] &quot;species&quot; &quot;stateProvince&quot; ## [3] &quot;individualCount&quot; &quot;decimalLatitude&quot; ## [5] &quot;decimalLongitude&quot; &quot;coordinateUncertaintyInMeters&quot; ## [7] &quot;coordinatePrecision&quot; &quot;elevation&quot; ## [9] &quot;elevationAccuracy&quot; &quot;month&quot; ## [11] &quot;year&quot; &quot;speciesKey&quot; Save cleaning data "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Import necessary packages. Create a function which can be used to analyze our data. Load data Shorten the column names so they donâ€™t overlap in the plot. visualize the missing pattern Observing the plot, we can easily find out some correlations among some factors. LA means latitude and LO means longitude, so if one of them is missing, the other one must be missing too. The plot reveals this correlation. The similar correlation also appears between EA(elevation accuracy) and ELE(elevation). Another correlation is between Y(year) and M(month). Year is more easily be recorded than month. COPRE(coordinate precision), EA and ELE are more likely to be missing. COUN(coordinate uncertainty in meter) has no missing because we first downloaded data with limitation of COUN smaller than 10000. And SP(species), SK(species key) has no missing data because at chapter 3 we purge all missing species key data. ST(state), Y has no missing at all. ST(state) and Y(year) is much easier to record.
