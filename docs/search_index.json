The data we chose whose plants are found in US and discover time is from 1971 to 2021. It has restriction that the basis of record must be human observation and the coordinate uncertainty in metres must be smaller than 10000, in order to help us conclude certain results. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Import necessary packages. Import data The data has some information about taxonRank which is higher than species. That is because the species data is missing. ## family genus taxonRank decimalLatitude decimalLongitude ## 4 Hypnaceae Hypnum GENUS 44.31670 -104.6833 ## 5 Orthotrichaceae Orthotrichum GENUS 45.53330 -109.8167 ## 6 Isoetaceae Isoetes GENUS 34.30690 -80.9853 ## 7 Bryaceae Rosulabryum GENUS 39.45000 -122.7500 ## 8 Sphagnaceae Sphagnum GENUS 45.53330 -84.6667 ## 9 ORDER 31.59056 -110.5067 ## 10 Sphagnaceae Sphagnum GENUS 39.41670 -79.0667 ## 11 Mniaceae FAMILY 41.81342 -124.0647 ## 14 Haloragaceae Myriophyllum GENUS 38.52333 -121.7861 ## 15 Rhabdoweisiaceae Amphidium GENUS 38.91419 -123.2563 We do not know this kind of information belongs to which specific species. And we know that the living area of different species in the same genus could be much different. For example, two data with same genus without species information has much different latitude and longitude. ## family genus taxonRank decimalLatitude decimalLongitude ## 23 Orthotrichaceae Zygodon GENUS 41.80417 -124.0604 ## 210403 Orthotrichaceae Zygodon GENUS 20.76878 -156.2339 Therefore, we should use the information of taxonRank which is species or lower rank and drop the higher rank. Since all species have speciesKey, we can easily drop data with no speciesKey. Check columns and choose informative ones. ## [1] &quot;gbifID&quot; &quot;datasetKey&quot; ## [3] &quot;occurrenceID&quot; &quot;kingdom&quot; ## [5] &quot;phylum&quot; &quot;class&quot; ## [7] &quot;order&quot; &quot;family&quot; ## [9] &quot;genus&quot; &quot;species&quot; ## [11] &quot;infraspecificEpithet&quot; &quot;taxonRank&quot; ## [13] &quot;scientificName&quot; &quot;verbatimScientificName&quot; ## [15] &quot;verbatimScientificNameAuthorship&quot; &quot;countryCode&quot; ## [17] &quot;locality&quot; &quot;stateProvince&quot; ## [19] &quot;occurrenceStatus&quot; &quot;individualCount&quot; ## [21] &quot;publishingOrgKey&quot; &quot;decimalLatitude&quot; ## [23] &quot;decimalLongitude&quot; &quot;coordinateUncertaintyInMeters&quot; ## [25] &quot;coordinatePrecision&quot; &quot;elevation&quot; ## [27] &quot;elevationAccuracy&quot; &quot;depth&quot; ## [29] &quot;depthAccuracy&quot; &quot;eventDate&quot; ## [31] &quot;day&quot; &quot;month&quot; ## [33] &quot;year&quot; &quot;taxonKey&quot; ## [35] &quot;speciesKey&quot; &quot;basisOfRecord&quot; ## [37] &quot;institutionCode&quot; &quot;collectionCode&quot; ## [39] &quot;catalogNumber&quot; &quot;recordNumber&quot; ## [41] &quot;identifiedBy&quot; &quot;dateIdentified&quot; ## [43] &quot;license&quot; &quot;rightsHolder&quot; ## [45] &quot;recordedBy&quot; &quot;typeStatus&quot; ## [47] &quot;establishmentMeans&quot; &quot;lastInterpreted&quot; ## [49] &quot;mediaType&quot; &quot;issue&quot; ## [1] &quot;species&quot; &quot;stateProvince&quot; ## [3] &quot;individualCount&quot; &quot;decimalLatitude&quot; ## [5] &quot;decimalLongitude&quot; &quot;coordinateUncertaintyInMeters&quot; ## [7] &quot;coordinatePrecision&quot; &quot;elevation&quot; ## [9] &quot;elevationAccuracy&quot; &quot;month&quot; ## [11] &quot;year&quot; &quot;speciesKey&quot; We also notice that some species only appear several times.

"],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Visualize the missing pattern of the data which we have purged before. Observing the plot, we can easily find out some correlations among some factors. LA means latitude and LO means longitude, so if one of them is missing, the other one must be missing too. The plot reveals this correlation. The similar correlation also appears between EA(elevation accuracy) and ELE(elevation). Another correlation is between Y(year) and M(month). Year is more easily be recorded than month. COPRE(coordinate precision), EA and ELE are more likely to be missing. COUN(coordinate uncertainty in meter) has no missing because we first downloaded data with limitation of COUN smaller than 10000. And SP(species), SK(species key) has no missing data because at chapter 3 we purge all missing species key data. ST(state), Y has no missing at all. ST(state) and Y(year) is much easier to record. Although LA, LO and M have some missing values, these cases are actually very small. We can notice the top graph that it is not very obvious to show that these columns have missing values. As for the right graph, we can find that the missing pattern that these columns have are smallest subset in the whole data. Therefore, we can think these columns have no missing values. We still hope to use the changes of elevation of plants to draw more interesting conclusions, though much data lose it. We try to find that are there some species with elevation recorded for many years. We first observe the correlation between missing elevation and years. Although most of species do not have elevation each year, we can find that there might be few of them recorded for continuous years. In addition, we can plot the count of species have different missing elevation. We can observe that if we use the percent of missing elevation which is lower than 30, we could have nearly 100 species to draw some conclusions about elevation.
