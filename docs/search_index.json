When we talk about global warming, we will imagine the glacier melts in the polar region and high mountains, sea level rises making some islands sink, and summer becomes hotter than past years. Global warming not only changes human life, but also impacts all living things around the world. Through this opportunity, we analyze the occurrences of plants in the last 50 years in US, hoping to find out some changes happened. For example, latitude and elevation of plants may change since plants may live in higher latitude or higher elevation area mainly as years pass because of global warming. In addition, in the data of occurrences of plants in the last 50 years in US we find that Miconia calvescens has the maximum records. Miconia calvescens is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to Mexico and Central and South America and it has become one of the world’s most invasive species. In Hawaii, it is commonly referred to as the “purple plague”, and threatens to destroy entire ecosystems. The Invasive Species Specialist Group list the tree as one of the world’s 100 most invasive species in the Global Invasive Species Database. We are interested in its spread in US. In this project, we collect the plant data with restrictions of coordinate uncertainty in metres in US in the last 50 years in GBIF(Global Biodiversity Information Facility). The download link is: https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.kym9t4. We would like to carry out analysis from both geographic and time series perspectives and answer the following questions: Does latitude of plants in US change in the last 50 years? What are the areas Miconia calvescens lives at present? Are living conditions of these areas different? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Since GBIF provides some simple selection to purge data. The data we chose whose plants are found in US and discover time is from 1971 to 2021. It has restrictions that the basis of record must be human observation and the coordinate uncertainty in metres must be smaller than 10000, in order to help us draw more accurate results. Some columns explanations as follows. datasetKey The occurrence dataset key (a uuid) scientificName A scientific name from the GBIF backbone. All included and synonym taxa are included in the search. countryCode The 2-letter country code (as per ISO-3166-1) of the country in which the occurrence was recorded. See here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 locality (character) The specific description of the place. stateProvince (character) The name of the next smaller administrative region than country (state, province, canton, department, region, etc.) in which the Location occurs. occurrenceStatus Type status of the specimen. publishingOrgKey (character) The publishing organization key (a UUID). decimalLatitude Latitude in decimals between -90 and 90 based on WGS 84. Supports range queries, smaller,larger (e.g., ‘25,30’, whereas ‘30,25’ wouldn’t work) decimalLongitude Longitude in decimals between -180 and 180 based on WGS 84. Supports range queries (e.g., ‘-0.4,-0.2’, whereas ‘-0.2,-0.4’ wouldn’t work). elevation Elevation in meters above sea level. Supports range queries, smaller,larger (e.g., ‘5,30’, whereas ‘30,5’ wouldn’t work) depth Depth in meters relative to elevation. For example 10 meters below a lake surface with given elevation. Supports range queries, smaller,larger (e.g., ‘5,30’, whereas ‘30,5’ wouldn’t work) eventDate Occurrence date in ISO 8601 format: yyyy, yyyy-MM, yyyy-MM-dd, or MM-dd. Supports range queries, smaller,larger (e.g., ‘1990,1991’, whereas ‘1991,1990’ wouldn’t work) month The month of the year, starting with 1 for January. Supports range queries, smaller,larger (e.g., ‘1,2’, whereas ‘2,1’ wouldn’t work) year The 4 digit year. A year of 98 will be interpreted as AD 98. Supports range queries, smaller,larger (e.g., ‘1990,1991’, whereas ‘1991,1990’ wouldn’t work) taxonKey (numeric) A taxon key from the GBIF backbone. All included and synonym taxa are included in the search, so a search for aves with taxononKey=212 (i.e. /occurrence/search?taxonKey=212) will match all birds, no matter which species. You can pass many keys by passing occ_search in a call to an lapply-family function. basisOfRecord Basis of record, as defined in our BasisOfRecord enum here https://gbif.github.io/gbif-api/apidocs/org/gbif/api/vocabulary/BasisOfRecord.html Acceptable values are: FOSSIL_SPECIMEN An occurrence record describing a fossilized specimen. HUMAN_OBSERVATION An occurrence record describing an observation made by one or more people. LITERATURE An occurrence record based on literature alone. LIVING_SPECIMEN An occurrence record describing a living specimen, e.g. MACHINE_OBSERVATION An occurrence record describing an observation made by a machine. OBSERVATION An occurrence record describing an observation. PRESERVED_SPECIMEN An occurrence record describing a preserved specimen. UNKNOWN Unknown basis for the record. institutionCode An identifier of any form assigned by the source to identify the institution the record belongs to. Not guaranteed to be que. collectionCode An identifier of any form assigned by the source to identify the physical collection or digital dataset uniquely within the text of an institution. license (character) The type license applied to the dataset or record. Possible values: CC0_1_0, CC_BY_4_0, CC_BY_NC_4_0, UNSPECIFIED, and UNSUPPORTED recordedBy The person who recorded the occurrence. lastInterpreted Date the record was last modified in GBIF, in ISO 8601 format: yyyy, yyyy-MM, yyyy-MM-dd, or MM-dd. Supports range queries, smaller,larger (e.g., ‘1990,1991’, whereas ‘1991,1990’ wouldn’t work) mediaType Media type. Default is NULL, so no filtering on mediatype. Options: NULL, ‘MovingImage’, ‘Sound’, and ‘StillImage’. issue (character) One or more of many possible issues with each occurrence record. See Details. Issues passed to this parameter filter results by the issue. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The data has some information about taxonRank which is higher than species. That is because the species data is missing. ## family genus taxonRank decimalLatitude decimalLongitude ## 4 Hypnaceae Hypnum GENUS 44.31670 -104.6833 ## 5 Orthotrichaceae Orthotrichum GENUS 45.53330 -109.8167 ## 6 Isoetaceae Isoetes GENUS 34.30690 -80.9853 ## 7 Bryaceae Rosulabryum GENUS 39.45000 -122.7500 ## 8 Sphagnaceae Sphagnum GENUS 45.53330 -84.6667 ## 9 ORDER 31.59056 -110.5067 ## 10 Sphagnaceae Sphagnum GENUS 39.41670 -79.0667 ## 11 Mniaceae FAMILY 41.81342 -124.0647 ## 14 Haloragaceae Myriophyllum GENUS 38.52333 -121.7861 ## 15 Rhabdoweisiaceae Amphidium GENUS 38.91419 -123.2563 We do not know this kind of information belongs to which specific species. And we know that the living area of different species in the same genus could be much different. For example, two data with same genus without species information has much different latitude and longitude. ## family genus taxonRank decimalLatitude decimalLongitude ## 23 Orthotrichaceae Zygodon GENUS 41.80417 -124.0604 ## 210403 Orthotrichaceae Zygodon GENUS 20.76878 -156.2339 Therefore, we should use the information of taxonRank which is species or lower rank and drop the higher rank. Since all species have speciesKey, we can easily drop data with no speciesKey.

Observing the plot, we can easily find out some correlations among some factors. LA means latitude and LO means longitude, so if one of them is missing, the other one must be missing too. The plot reveals this correlation. The similar correlation also appears between DP(depth) and DPA(depth accuracy), and EA(elevation accuracy) and ELE(elevation). Another correlation is between Y(year) and M(month). Year is more easily be recorded than month. COPRE(coordinate precision), DP, DPA, EA and ELE are more likely to be missing. It is sad that we cannot use depth and elevation to present one of changes of plants. COUN(coordinate uncertainty in meter) has no missing because we first downloaded data with limitation of COUN smaller than 10000. And SP(species), SK(species key) has no missing data because at chapter 3 we purge all missing species key data. ST(state), Y has no missing at all. ST(state) and Y(year) is much easier to record. Although LA, LO and M have some missing values, these cases are actually very small. We can notice the top graph that it is not very obvious to show that these columns have missing values. As for the right graph, we can find that the missing pattern that these columns have are smallest subset in the whole data. Therefore, we can think these columns have no missing values.
